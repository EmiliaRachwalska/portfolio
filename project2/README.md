Assignment 2 from Statistical Learning: Given 5 datasets, and following information about them:  
Data Set 1 Download Data Set 1: The log odds is a quadratic function of the features, and the covariance matrices of the features vary significantly between classes.  
Data Set 2 Download Data Set 2: The features are mutually independent, and within each target class, each feature follows a normal distribution with variances of either 1 or 10.  
Data Set 3 Download Data Set 3: The log odds is a highly nonlinear function of the features.  
Data Set 4 Download Data Set 4: The Linear Discriminant Analysis classifier outperforms all benchmark estimators, despite the features not being normally distributed.  
Data Set 5 Download Data Set 5:  The features follow a joint normal distribution within each target class.  
I was supposed to perform analysis about each of them and pick the most suitable method to use in the model for each dataset and then make predictions and put them into csv file.
