Assignment 1 from Statistical Learning: Given 5 datasets, and following information about them: \\
Data Set 1 Download Data Set 1: Some features are not useful.
Data Set 2 Download Data Set 2: All variables, including both features and targets, are highly influenced by a limited number of common, unobservable variables.
Data Set 3 Download Data Set 3: The regression coefficients decrease rapidly in absolute value, and the features are not highly correlated.
Data Set 4 Download Data Set 4:  The regression coefficients decrease slowly in absolute value, and the features are not highly correlated.
Data Set 5 Download Data Set 5: All features are useful.
I was supposed to perform analysis about each of them and pick the most suitable method to use in the model for each dataset and then make predictions and put them into csv file.
